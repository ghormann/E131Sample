# E131Sample
These are some basic examples of how to send E131 data in different languages.   It should be noted that 
1. most controllers expect you send a message at lease once every few seconds
1. Some controls have a maximum number of packets for 1ms to avoid dropping packets.  (The old Alphapix line will drop packets of you don't pause for example.)
